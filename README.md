# Jenkins-Pipelines-CI-CD

This repository contains various implementations of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using Jenkins. The goal is to provide practical examples and reusable configurations for automating the build, test, and deployment processes of modern applications.

## Repository Structure

### 1. **3-Tier-Agent**
   - Implements a three-tier architecture pipeline.
   - Highlights:
     - Multi-stage pipeline with distinct stages for frontend, backend, and database tiers.
     - Example configurations for setting up the environment and deploying each tier.

### 2. **Docker-Agent**
   - Focuses on using Docker containers as Jenkins agents.
   - Highlights:
     - Example `Jenkinsfile` for running builds in isolated Docker environments.
     - Steps to build and deploy Docker-based applications.

### 3. **todo-app-jenkins-k8s**
   - Contains a sample application (To-Do App) demonstrating Kubernetes integration.
   - Highlights:
     - Kubernetes manifests (`pod.yaml`, `service.yaml`) for deploying the app.
     - Jenkins pipeline for building, pushing Docker images, and deploying to Kubernetes.

## Features

- **Automated Pipelines**: Automates the complete CI/CD lifecycle, including build, test, and deploy stages.
- **Docker Integration**: Leverages Docker for containerized builds and deployments.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Demonstrates deploying applications to Kubernetes clusters.
- **Scalability**: Configurations are designed to be scalable and adaptable to various project requirements.

## Requirements

- **Jenkins**: Installed and configured Jenkins instance.
- **Docker**: Required for containerized builds.
- **Kubernetes**: For deploying Kubernetes manifests.
- **Git**: Version control system for managing code.
